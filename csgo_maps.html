							<p>Looking at the chart, it's interesting to see how the rounds become more CT-sided as the players' skill level increases.
								My guess is that defending bomb sites becomes easier the more familiar the players are with the map and the game's mechanics.</p>
							<p>It doesn't surprise me that nuke, inferno, and train are all CT-sided. Those are all maps that can be held easily with good CT coverage. 
								Aztec, dust, and vertigo are of course incredibly CT-sided, which is why the maps are never in the competitive circuit. 
								I haven't played the new cbble so not much to say on that. Other than that, overpass looks promising balance-wise.</p>
							<p>And of course, de_dust2 still remains the most balanced map in CS history. =D</p>
