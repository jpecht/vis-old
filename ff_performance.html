							<p>As the football season ends, I wanted to measure how well football players performed in ESPN's
								fantasy football league relative to how they were ranked when they were drafted. 
								In short, it's measuring each player's expectations vs. their performance.</p>
							<p>The format is still in snake draft form and players are placed based on their average draft
								pick rank. <span style="font-weight:400">A <span style="color:rgb(33,102,172);">blue</span>
								player represents a "sleeper" pick: someone who really exceeded expectations;
								a <span style="color:rgb(178,24,43);">red</span> player represents a "bust":
								someone who did not do as well as expected.</span> Because some positions score more than others
								by nature (e.g. QBs), the comparisons made are within each player's football position 
								(thank you casey for pointing that out).</p>
							<p>And...if you were wondering about my fantasy football team, which I know you are, I lost my semi-final
								game, mostly due to Dez Bryant's 3 TD game... but! I thought I did pretty well considering I
								had drafted AP and Ray Rice haha.</p>
