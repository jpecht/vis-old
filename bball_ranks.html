							<p>Fantasy basketball scoring has always struck me as odd. Instead of scoring based off points, nine categories are totaled over an entire week 
								and the team that wins the most categories wins for the week. So the players that can score well off each of these nine categories are the most valuable. 
								Players like Kobe, who averages more than five turnovers a game, could kill your team in the turnover category.</p>
							<p>So below I present a ranking system that shows which players were the most valuable during the 2013-2014 season... a slight indication for the upcoming season, but 
								obviously doesn't take into account things like players moving teams or KD getting injured.</p>
							<p>The main scoring column is calculated by taking the sum of the Z-scores for each stat out of the top 200 players using a normal distribution. 
								<span style="font-weight:400">So, a <span style="color:rgb(33,102,172);">positive</span> score indicates above average performance, 
								while a <span style="color:rgb(178,24,43);">negative</span> score indicates below average performance.</span>
								As you can see, poor Kobe doesn't even break the top 100 (he ranks at 194).</p>
