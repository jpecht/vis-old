							<p>This is a collection of data from ESPN's fantasy football leagues. Each player is vertically positioned
								based on their average draft pick. The players are colored based on their football position.
								The darker the color, the more often the player is drafted, and players that have a gold border have a 100% draft rate.</p>
							<p>One caveat to this visualization is the random horizontal placement of the players. This leads to a different chart each time the page is loaded 
								and therefore can lead to varying subconscious interpretations, especially if say, one color decides to randomly cluster together. 
								The most straightforward solution would be to set the location of each player...but I kind've enjoy the randomness because it makes it feel
								more genuine somehow.</p>
							<p>Another thought I had was to give the option to color each player by their team rather by their position. I imagine some teams would 
								appear towards the top more than others.</p>
